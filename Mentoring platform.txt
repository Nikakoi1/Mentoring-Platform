Resulting Prompt (generated by Google AI Studio) 

Prompt: "Design and develop a sophisticated, secure, and user-centric web application for the ASP Mentoring Programme. This platform will empower ASPs to strengthen their technical and soft skills in financial advisory services for rural SMEs. Implement three distinct, intuitive role-based dashboards for Coordinators (program oversight, analytics, performance evaluation), Mentors (mentee management, session conduct, report submission), and Mentees (resource access, session scheduling, self-assessments). The application must seamlessly integrate a robust framework for onboarding and matching, detailed session tracking (individual and group), experiential learning assignments, and a comprehensive M&E system including baseline/endline assessments, mentor reports, mentee reflections, and SME feedback, all aligned with the EMCC 2015 competency model. Emphasize a clean, modern UI/UX with clear data visualization for progress monitoring and performance evaluation. Leverage Supabase for secure user authentication, real-time data synchronization, efficient database management for all programme data (assessments, reports, progress), and secure file storage for resources and evaluation forms. The goal is to create an engaging, impactful, and scalable digital hub that fosters continuous professional development and expands outreach to new ASPs. Provide a visual mock-up of the Coordinator Dashboard showcasing key analytics and mentor/mentee performance."

Prompt for mentoring programm  

I'll create a comprehensive web application for managing the ASP mentoring programme with three main user roles:


Coordinators - Dashboard to oversee the entire programme, view analytics, and evaluate performance
Mentors - Interface to manage mentees, conduct sessions, and submit reports  
Mentees - Access to mentoring resources, session scheduling, and self-assessments


The platform will include baseline assessments, session tracking, progress monitoring, and evaluation tools based on the detailed programme structure provided.

I've created a comprehensive mentoring programme management platform with role-based dashboards for coordinators, mentors, and mentees. The application includes session tracking, progress monitoring, assessment tools, and evaluation features based on the detailed programme structure you provided.

Context information to consider by developing the comprehensive web application for managing ASP mentoring programme. 

I want to manage the mentoring project. I want here to build a webpage where mentor and mentee can meet each other, and coordination can see and evaluate the performance. The webpage is not necessary, they can do it in figma sub-apps. Below you can find the descriptive text. 

Mentoring Programme Design Document
Strengthening ASPs’ Technical and Soft Skills for Delivering Financial Advisory Services to Rural SMEs

This document provides:
•	Structure & methodology.
•	Implementation phases.
•	Monitoring & evaluation with indicators.
•	Sustainability measures.

1. Background & Rationale
Over the past years, several initiatives have been implemented to strengthen Accounting Service Providers (ASPs) through workshops, training content, service extension support, and video lectures. Building on these initiatives, there is a need for a structured mentoring programme that will:
•	Support ASPs who have completed the online training in financial advisory services.
•	Strengthen both technical and soft skills to enhance service delivery to SMEs.
•	Expand outreach beyond ASPs already engaged in prior programmes by involving new ASPs.
The mentoring programme will leverage trained champion ASPs as regional mentors to provide practical guidance, hands-on learning, and continuous support.

2. Programme Objectives
1.	Enhance technical competencies of ASPs in SME financial advisory services.
2.	Strengthen soft skills (communication, client engagement, advisory delivery, and trust-building).
3.	Encourage integration of SME financial advisory services into ASPs’ broader service offerings.
4.	Expand outreach to new ASPs beyond the current federation networks.

3. Target Group
•	ASPs who have completed the online financial advisory services course.
•	ASPs not previously engaged in earlier initiatives (priority).
•	Both federation-affiliated and independent ASPs.

4. Programme Structure & Duration
•	Duration: 3–4 months.
•	Format: Blended mentoring – combining individual sessions, group learning, and peer exchanges.
•	Regional Focus: Each region will have 1–2 champion ASP mentors.

Programme Phases:
1.	Onboarding & Matching (Weeks 1–2):
o	Identify and select ASPs and mentors. 
1.	The competency framework (EMCC 2015) is suitable for all kinds of mentoring, including eight competence categories focusing on personal and interpersonal skills, as well as the mentoring process: 1) Understanding self, 2) Commitment to self-development, 3) Managing the contract, 4) Building the relationship, 5) Enabling insight and learning, 6) Outcome and action orientation, 7) Use of models and techniques, and 8) Evaluation. The competence framework for evaluation purposes is given Tool 4.  
o	Orientation for both mentors and mentees.
o	Mentor–mentee pairing based on needs and expertise.
2.	Mentorship Sessions (Weeks 3–12):
o	Bi-weekly one-on-one mentoring sessions (virtual or in-person).
o	Monthly group learning workshops (case discussions, peer-to-peer learning).
o	Practical assignments (e.g., financial analysis of SME cases, advisory simulations).
3.	Reflection & Consolidation (Weeks 13–16):
o	Sharing of experiences in regional learning events.
o	Documentation of success stories and lessons learned.
o	Graduation ceremony and certification of mentees.

5. Mentoring Methodology
•	Competency-based: Focus on SME financial advisory skills (e.g., ratio analysis, cash flow assessment, risk analysis).
•	Experiential Learning: Case-based discussions, role-playing, shadowing mentors, and field practice.
•	Soft Skills Development: Emphasis on trust-building, client relations, and effective communication.
•	Peer Learning: Small group discussions to promote knowledge exchange among mentees.
•	Continuous Support: WhatsApp/Telegram groups for Q&A and resource sharing.

6. Roles & Responsibilities
•	Programme Coordination Team: Oversees implementation, monitoring, and logistics.
•	Regional Mentors (Champion ASPs): Deliver mentoring, support mentees, report progress.
•	ASPs (Mentees): Actively participate, complete assignments, apply learnings in SME engagements.
•	Federations: Mobilize new ASPs, provide visibility, support mentors.

7. Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) Framework
Purpose: To assess effectiveness of the mentoring programme in improving ASPs’ technical and soft skills and enabling better SME service delivery.

M&E Tools & Processes:
•	Baseline & Endline Assessments: Skills self-assessment surveys for mentees.
•	Mentor Reports: Short monthly progress reports (attendance, topics covered, observations).
•	Mentee Reflections: Bi-monthly reflection forms on challenges and achievements.
•	SME Feedback: Short survey/interview with SMEs who received services from mentees.
•	Programme Review: Mid-term and endline review sessions with mentors.

Key Indicators:
Level	Indicator	Means of Verification	Frequency
Output	# of ASPs enrolled in mentoring programme	Programme records	Start
	# of mentors trained and active	Mentor database	Start
	# of mentoring sessions conducted (individual & group)	Session attendance logs	Bi-weekly
Outcome	% of mentees reporting improved technical skills	Baseline/endline survey	Endline
	% of mentees reporting improved soft skills	Self-assessment forms	Endline
	# of SMEs served by mentees during programme	SME service records	Ongoing
	% of SMEs reporting satisfaction with ASP advisory services	SME feedback survey	Endline
Impact	% of mentees integrating financial advisory services into their portfolio	Follow-up survey/interview	3 months post-programme

8. Sustainability & Scaling
•	Mentors remain engaged as peer-learning leaders within federations.
•	Resource toolkit (case studies, assignments, guidance notes) made available for future cohorts.
•	Federation networks encouraged to institutionalize mentorship as a regular support mechanism.
